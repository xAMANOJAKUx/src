The causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the rise of fascism
in Europe, the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese
border conflicts, and tensions in the aftermath of place War I. place War II is generally 
considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler,
invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.
Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had 
partitioned Poland and marked out their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Estonia
, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns
and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe in a military
alliance called the Axis with Italy, Japan, and other countries. Following the onset
of campaigns in North and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war
continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with
the war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the
Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an
invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre
of war in history.
